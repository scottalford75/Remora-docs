Understanding the Remora Config file
====================================

The Remora config file has many options for the user customize for their specific use cases.
We will cover each module and how to configure it.



| There are 2 ways to currently customize a config file.
| The first is to open it in a text editor. Notepad++ preferred.
| The second is to use a tool
| https://github.com/aaronCNC/Remora-GUI-Config-Tool



Board
-----
This definition is a user note only and is not used by the firmware. Examples

.. code-block::

    "Board": "BIGTREETECH SKR v1.3 & v1.4"
	"Board": "MKS SBASE v1.3"

Pin
-----
Pin names and definations need to match your boards schematics and pin naming structure. The LPC176x based boards use pins with an n.nn naming scheme. STM32 based boards use a Px_n naming scheme, RT1052 using a Pn_nn, and Rpi Pico using GPnn.  Examples

.. code-block::

    "Board": "BIGTREETECH SKR v1.3 & v1.4"
   		"Pin":				"1.31"
	
    
    "Board": "SKR v2.0 & Octopus"
   		"Pin":				"PC_4"

    "Board": "RT1052"
   		"Pin":				"P1_14"

    "Board": "PICO2040"
   		"Pin":				"GP14"


MCP4451
-------
| If Board is set to "MKS SBASE v1.3"
| You will need the following for the digital pots to set the motor current.

.. code-block::

	{
	"Thread": "On load",
	"Type": "MCP4451",
	"Comment": "Digipot for joints/Axis 0 - 3",
		"I2C SDA pin": "0.0",
		"I2C SCL pin": "0.1",
		"I2C address": 0,
		"Max current": 2.0,
		"Factor": 113.33,
		"Current 0": 0.8,
		"Current 1": 0.8,
		"Current 2": 0.8,
		"Current 3": 0.8
	},
	{
	"Thread": "On load",
	"Type": "MCP4451",
		"Comment": "Digipot for joints/Axis 4 - 7",
		"I2C SDA pin": "0.0",
		"I2C SCL pin": "0.1",
		"I2C address": 2,
		"Max current": 2.0,
		"Factor": 113.33,
		"Current 0": 0.8,
		"Current 1": 0.8,
		"Current 2": 0.8,
		"Current 3": 0.8
	},

**Current 0-3** (0.0-2.0) The value enter here sets the current in amps. Note the comment on the above the first entry is for the first 4 joints/Axis (X,Y,Z,E0) and the second is for the last 4 joints/Axis (E1,E2,E3,E4)

TMC stepper
-----------
| This allows Remora to adjust the parameters of TMC based stepper drivers.

.. code-block::

	{
	"Thread": "On load",
	"Type": "TMC2208",

		"Microsteps":		16,
		"Stealth chop":		"on",
	},
	
| **Type:**	(TMC2208,TMC2209) Sets the TMC driver chip type
| **Comment:** is just for the user to give a custom name to keep track of what it is set to and has no effect on the machine.
| **RX pin:** Sets the RX pin for communication with the driver
| **RSense:** (sense resistor value in ohms) This should match the drivers sense resistor
| **Current:** (0-2500) This sets the driver current in milliamps 
| **Microsteps:** (1-256) Sets the micro steps for the driver
| **Stealth chop:** (on, off) Enabled or disables stealth chop for silent operation

Stepgen

		"Joint Number":			0,
		"Step Pin":			"2.2",
		"Direction Pin":		"2.6",

	},

| **Comment:** is just for the user to give a custom name to keep track of what it is set to and has no effect on the machine.
| **Joint Number:** (0-8) This is where you link the join/axis to LinuxCNC. This number must match what is set in your hal file.
| **Step/Direction/Enable* Pins:** These are user set pin to connect to your motor driver.
- Note: "Enable Pin" as a config entry is only used on the SPI version, for other versions, a Digital Pin configured as an output is used

Digital Pin
-----------
This module can create an input or output. This is useful for things like home and limit switches or controlling relays and such.

.. code-block::

    {
	"Thread": "Servo",
	"Type": "Digital Pin",

| **Data Bit:** (0-15) This is where you link the module to LinuxCNC and can be set to a number between 0-15 
| when "Mode:" is set as "Output" you can set this to any number 0-15 but do not use the same number twice. This give the user 16 total unique outputs.
| when "Mode:" is set as "Input" you can set this to any number 0-15 but do not use the same number twice. This give the user 16 total unique Inputs. (this is shared with encoders)

| **Hardware PWM:** (True, False) This enables hardware PWM, it will limit what pins you can use but in return will give better and more adjustable PWM signals.
| **Variable Freq:** (True, False) This enables variable PWM feq only if hardware PWM is set to True
| **Period SP[i]:** (1-20) This allows the user to change the length of the pulse only if hardware PWM is set to True

Switch
---------
The switch can turn on and off a pin based on the value of a thermistor or other module with a PV[i]

.. code-block::

    {
	"Thread": "Servo",
	"Type": "Switch",
		"Comment":			"temp0 fan",

| **Pin:** What pin the switch is connected to.
| **Mode:** (On, Off) what action to take when SP is reached
| **PV[i]:** what module to watch. IE if this is for a cooling fan set this the same as the thermistor.
| **SP:** The set point value for when the switch should activate.

Blink
---------
This will turn a pin on and off useful for leds

.. code-block::

    {
	"Thread": "Servo",
	"Type": "Blink",
		"Pin":				"1.18",
		"Frequency":		2
	},
	
| **Pin:** What pin the blink is connected to.
| **Frequency:** (1-20000) sets the Frequency the pin will cycle from on to off.

Motor Power
---------
The Motor Power module can turn on a pin at startup with no user interaction. This is required for boards with motor power hardware that needs an io to be turned on. For boards like the SKRv2 this is required for the motors to recive power. Example

.. code-block::

   {
	"Thread": "On load",
	"Type": "Motor Power",
	"Comment": "Enable motor power SKR2",
	"Pin": "PC_13"
	}


Reset Pin
---------
The reset pin allows for a controller board reset initiated from LinuxCNC. The Pin can be freely assigned to any free pin on the controller board, but it is hard coded to pin 25 on the Raspberry Pi.

.. code-block::

    {
	"Thread": "Servo",
	"Type": "Reset Pin",
		"Comment":			"Reset pin",
		"Pin":				"1.31"
	}

ESTOP pin
---------
The ESTOP pin allows for a controller board to Estop directy from PRU instead of from LinuxCNC via a DigitalPin. The Pin can be freely assigned to any free pin on the controller board. 

.. code-block::

	{
	"Thread": "Servo",
    	"Type": "eStop",
        "Comment":                      "estop pin",
        "Pin":                          "PB_3"
   	 },

Base Thread Frequency 
---------------------
The Base thread frequecny configuration default is 40000. Depending on the chip you are using, this number can be higher or lower. Some boards with faster chips can acheave higher steprates by setting to a higher base thread frequency. The base thread frequency set in the config.txt file must match the base thread frequency set in your hal file for Linuxcnc.

.. code-block::

	{
	"Board": "BIGTREETECH SKR v2",
	"Threads":[
	{
	"Thread": "Base",
	"Frequency": 80000
	}
	],
